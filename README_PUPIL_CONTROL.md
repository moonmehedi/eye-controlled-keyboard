# üëÅÔ∏è Pupil Mouse Control for Paralyzed Users

A comprehensive eye-tracking mouse control system designed specifically for completely paralyzed individuals. This system uses advanced computer vision to track pupil movement and provides multiple clicking methods for accessibility.

## üéØ Features

### Core Functionality
- **High-precision pupil tracking** - Tracks pupil position for accurate mouse control
- **Multiple click methods** - Blink, dwell, long blink, and wink options
- **Smooth movement** - Advanced smoothing algorithms to reduce jitter
- **Customizable sensitivity** - Adjustable to individual needs
- **Safety boundaries** - Prevents accidental clicks outside safe zones

### Accessibility Features
- **Dwell clicking** - Click by holding gaze steady (no physical movement required)
- **Multiple blink patterns** - Different blink types for different actions
- **Configuration saving** - Save personalized settings
- **Performance monitoring** - Real-time FPS and detection rate display
- **Zone-based navigation** - Simplified screen navigation

## üìã Requirements

### Hardware
- **Camera**: Any USB webcam (720p or higher recommended)
- **Lighting**: Good, even lighting on the face
- **Positioning**: Camera should be at eye level, 50-80cm away

### Software
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pyautogui`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Test your system**:
   ```bash
   python test_pupil_system.py
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Pupil Mouse Control
```bash
python pupil_mouse_control.py
```

### Advanced Version (Recommended)
```bash
python advanced_pupil_mouse.py
```

### System Test
```bash
python test_pupil_system.py
```

## üéÆ Controls

### Mouse Movement
- **Look around** - Move your eyes to control the mouse cursor
- **Sensitivity** - Adjustable with +/- keys during runtime

### Clicking Methods

#### 1. Blink Clicking
- **Quick blink** (0.1-0.3 seconds) - Left click
- **Long blink** (0.5+ seconds) - Right click

#### 2. Dwell Clicking
- **Hold gaze steady** for 1.5 seconds - Left click
- **Movement threshold** - 25 pixels (configurable)

#### 3. Wink Clicking (Optional)
- **Left wink** - Left click
- **Right wink** - Right click

### Keyboard Controls
- **'q'** - Quit the application
- **'s'** - Save current settings
- **'r'** - Reset to defaults
- **'c'** - Start calibration (coming soon)
- **'+'** - Increase sensitivity
- **'-'** - Decrease sensitivity
- **'d'** - Toggle dwell clicking

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Automatic Configuration
The system automatically saves your preferences in `pupil_mouse_config.json`:

```json
{
  "sensitivity": 1.8,
  "smoothing_factor": 10,
  "dwell_time": 1.5,
  "click_cooldown": 0.6,
  "ear_threshold": 0.22
}
```

### Manual Adjustments
You can edit the configuration file directly or use the runtime controls.

## üìä Performance Optimization

### For Best Results:
1. **Lighting**: Use even, soft lighting on your face
2. **Camera position**: Eye level, 50-80cm distance
3. **Background**: Plain, non-distracting background
4. **Stability**: Keep head as still as possible
5. **Calibration**: Run the test script first to verify detection

### Troubleshooting:
- **Low detection rate**: Improve lighting, adjust camera angle
- **Jittery movement**: Increase smoothing factor
- **Slow response**: Decrease smoothing factor
- **Accidental clicks**: Increase click cooldown time

## üîß Customization

### Sensitivity Adjustment
```python
# In the code, adjust these values:
self.sensitivity = 1.8  # Higher = more sensitive
self.smoothing_factor = 10  # Higher = smoother but slower
```

### Click Thresholds
```python
# Blink detection
self.ear_threshold = 0.22  # Lower = more sensitive to blinks
self.min_blink_frames = 2  # Minimum frames for blink
self.max_blink_frames = 8  # Maximum frames for blink
```

### Dwell Settings
```python
# Dwell clicking
self.dwell_time = 1.5  # Seconds to hold gaze
self.dwell_threshold = 25  # Pixels movement tolerance
```

## üéØ Scripts Overview

### 1. `pupil_mouse_control.py`
- Basic pupil tracking with blink and dwell clicking
- Good for initial testing and simple usage

### 2. `advanced_pupil_mouse.py`
- Full-featured version with all accessibility options
- Configuration saving/loading
- Performance monitoring
- Multiple click methods
- Recommended for regular use

### 3. `test_pupil_system.py`
- System verification and troubleshooting
- Performance testing
- Detection rate monitoring
- Run this first to verify your setup

### 4. `eye_mouse_control.py`
- Alternative implementation using eye movement
- Less precise but simpler
- Good backup option

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Built-in Safety
- **Fail-safe disabled** - Won't stop if mouse moves to corner (important for paralyzed users)
- **Click cooldown** - Prevents accidental rapid clicking
- **Boundary limits** - Keeps mouse within safe screen areas
- **Smooth movement** - Reduces erratic cursor behavior

### Emergency Controls
- **'q' key** - Always available to quit
- **Camera disconnection** - Automatically stops the system
- **Exception handling** - Graceful error recovery

## üîç Technical Details

### Eye Tracking Method
1. **Face detection** using MediaPipe Face Mesh
2. **Eye region extraction** from facial landmarks
3. **Pupil detection** using adaptive thresholding
4. **Gaze calculation** from pupil position relative to eye center
5. **Coordinate mapping** to screen space with smoothing

### Blink Detection
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** calculation
- **Temporal filtering** to distinguish blinks from normal eye movement
- **Dual-threshold system** for different blink types

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient processing** pipeline
- **Memory management** for real-time operation
- **Adaptive quality** based on system performance

## üìû Support

### Common Issues:
1. **"Import cv2 could not be resolved"** - Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
2. **"Import mediapipe could not be resolved"** - Install MediaPipe: `pip install mediapipe`
3. **Camera not working** - Check camera permissions and connections
4. **Poor detection** - Improve lighting and camera positioning

### Getting Help:
- Check the test script output for diagnostic information
- Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
- Ensure camera is working with other applications first

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
- **Voice commands** - Additional control method
- **Gesture recognition** - Facial expression commands
- **Multiple monitor support** - Extended desktop control
- **Mobile app** - Remote configuration and monitoring
- **Machine learning** - Adaptive learning for individual users
