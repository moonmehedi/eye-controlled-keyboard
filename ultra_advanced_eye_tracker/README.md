- Good lighting conditions
- Windows/Linux/MacOS

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

**Option A: Run the installer (Windows)**
```bash
install_dependencies.bat
```

**Option B: Manual installation**
```bash
# Activate your virtual environment first
D:\eye_control\eye-controlled-keyboard\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the System
```bash
python ultra_eye_tracker.py
```

## üéØ Calibration Process

1. **Press 'C'** to start calibration
2. **Look at each red target** for 4 seconds
3. **Keep your head still** during calibration
4. **25 points** will be calibrated automatically
5. **System auto-saves** calibration data

### Calibration Tips for Best Accuracy:
- Sit 60-80cm from the camera
- Ensure even lighting on your face
- Minimize head movement
- Look directly at each target center
- Blink normally (system handles blinks)

## üéÆ Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| **C** | Start calibration |
| **L** | Load saved calibration |
| **R** | Reset calibration |
| **S** | Save configuration |
| **V** | Run validation test |
| **Q** | Quit system |
| **ESC** | Emergency stop |

## üìä Performance Metrics

The system displays real-time metrics:

- **Confidence**: Gaze detection reliability (0.0-1.0)
- **Stability**: Movement stability metric
- **Velocity**: Current gaze movement speed
- **FPS**: System frame rate
- **Calibration Status**: Training state

## üîß Configuration

Edit `ultra_config.json` to customize:

```json
{
    "camera": {
        "width": 1920,      // Higher = better accuracy
        "height": 1080,
        "fps": 60          // Higher = smoother
    },
    "tracking": {
        "blink_threshold": 0.22,    // Lower = more sensitive
        "click_cooldown": 0.8       // Minimum time between clicks
    },
    "calibration": {
        "polynomial_degree": 3,     // Higher = more flexible mapping
        "grid_size": 5             // More points = better accuracy
    }
}
```

## üö´ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Camera not detected**
   - Check camera permissions
   - Try changing `device_id` in config

2. **Low accuracy**
   - Recalibrate with better lighting
   - Increase grid_size in config
   - Ensure stable head position

3. **Laggy movement**
   - Lower camera resolution
   - Reduce FPS if CPU is struggling
   - Close other applications

4. **Frequent false clicks**
   - Increase `blink_threshold`
   - Increase `click_cooldown`

### Performance Optimization:

- **CPU Usage**: Lower camera resolution/FPS
- **Accuracy**: Higher resolution, more calibration points
- **Smoothness**: Increase Kalman filter strength

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Accuracy Improvements:

1. **Kalman Filtering**: Reduces noise by 60-80%
2. **Polynomial Calibration**: Handles non-linear eye movements
3. **Adaptive Smoothing**: Balances responsiveness vs stability
4. **Temporal Prediction**: Anticipates movement for smoother tracking
5. **Multi-method Fusion**: Combines multiple detection algorithms

### Limitations:
